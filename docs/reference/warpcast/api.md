# Warpcast API Reference

This page documents public APIs provided by Warpcast with information that is not available on the protocol.

The hostname is always `https://api.warpcast.com`.

## Pagination

Paginated endpoints return a `next.cursor` property next to the `result` object. To fetch the
next page, send the value as a `cursor` query parameter. An optional `limit` query parameter can be used to
specify the page size.

```json
{
  "result": {
    ...
  },
  "next": {
    "cursor": "eyJwYWdlIjoxLCJsaW1pdCI6MTAwfQ"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Authenticated endpoints use a self-signed token, signed an an App Key for FID:

```tsx
import { NobleEd25519Signer } from "@farcaster/hub-nodejs";

// private / public keys of an App Key you are holding for an FID
const fid = 6841; //replace
const privateKey = 'secret'; // replace
const publicKey = 'pubkey'; // replace
const signer = new NobleEd25519Signer(new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(privateKey)));

const header = {
  fid,
  type: 'app_key',
  key: publicKey
};
const encodedHeader = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(header)).toString('base64url');

const payload = { exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 300 }; // 5 minutes
const encodedPayload = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(payload)).toString('base64url');

const signatureResult = await signer.signMessageHash(Buffer.from(`${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}`, 'utf-8'));
if (signatureResult.isErr()) {
  throw new Error("Failed to sign message");
}

const encodedSignature = Buffer.from(signatureResult.value).toString("base64url");

const authToken = encodedHeader + "." + encodedPayload + "." + encodedSignature;

await got.post(
  "https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-follows",
  {
	  body: { channelKey: 'evm' }
	  headers: {
	    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + authToken;
	  }
	}
)
```

## Concepts

- Channels: Warpcast has the concept of channels which build upon FIP-2 (setting `parentUrl` on casts). You can read more
  about channels in the [documentation](https://www.notion.so/warpcast/Channels-4f249d22575348a5a0488b5d86f0dd1c?pvs=4).

## Get All Channels

`GET /v2/all-channels`

List all channels. No parameters. Not paginated. Not authenticated.

Returns: a `channels` array with properties:

- `id` - unique channel id that cannot be changed (called 'Name' when creating a channel)
- `url` - FIP-2 `parentUrl` used for main casts in the channel
- `name` - friendly name displayed to users (called 'Display name' when editing a channel)
- `description` - description of the channel, if present
- `descriptionMentions` - an array of the user fids mentioned in the description. Multiple mentions result in multiple entries.
- `descriptionMentionsPositions` - the indexes within the description where the mentioned users (from `descriptionMentions`) appear.
  This array is always the same size as `descriptionMentions`. The mention is placed to the left of any existing character at that index.
- `leadFid` - fid of the user who created the channel, if present
- `moderatorFids` - fids of the moderators (under new channel membership scheme)
- `createdAt` - UNIX time when channel was created, in seconds
- `followerCount` - number of users following the channel
- `memberCount` - number of members of the channel, including the owner and moderators
- `pinnedCastHash` - hash of the cast pinned in the channel, if present
- `publicCasting` - `true`/`false` indicating whether channel allows anybody to cast into it, or only members
- `externalLink` - external link that appears in the header in Warpcast, if present, with 2 properties:
  - `title` - title shown in the channel header
  - `url` - url of the link

The caller must own or moderate the channel.

Body parameters:

- `channelId` - the id of the channel to ban the user from
- `banFid` - the fid of the user to ban

Returns:

- `success: true`

Example:

The caller must own or moderate the channel.

Body parameters:

- `channelId` - the id of the channel to unban the user from
- `unbanFid` - the fid of the user to unban

Returns:

- `success: true`

Example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \

- `channelId` - id of channel to follow or unfollow

**Examples**

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Auth Token>' -d '{ "channelId": "evm" }' https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-follows

curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Auth Token>' -d '{ "channelId": "evm" }' https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-follows
```

## Invite to Channel

`POST /fc/channel-invites`

Invites a user to be either a member or moderator of a channel. It is idempotent, i.e. if there is already an outstanding invite or the user already has the desired role, the API returns success. Authenticated.

The caller must own or moderate the channel.

**Note:** we can allowlist bots that are ok to be directly added as moderators to channels. Any channel owner can then add the bot as an active mod without the requirement that the bot is first a member or that it has to accept an invite. Let us know if you’d like your bot to be allowlisted.

Rate limit: 100 calls per caller per channel per hour

Body parameters:

- `channelId` - id of channel to invite user to
- `inviteFid` - fid of the user to invite
- `role` - either of:
  - `member`: invites the user to be a member. The user must already follow either the channel or the user calling the endpoint. The caller must be a channel moderator or the channel owner.
  - `moderator`: invites a user to be a moderator. The user must already be a channel member (i.e. has accepted a prior `member` invitation). The caller must be the channel owner. The number of active moderators + outstanding moderator invites cannot go above 10 (you’ll get an error).

Returns:

- `success: true`

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Auth Token>' \
  -d '{ "channelId": "evm", "inviteFid": 341234, "role": "member" }' \
  https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-invites
```

## Remove from Channel

`DELETE /fc/channel-invites`

Removes a user from a channel role, including revoking any outstanding unaccepted invite. It is idempotent, i.e. if the user does not have an invite for the role or does not have the role, the API returns success. Authenticated.

The caller must own or moderate the channel.

Rate limit: 100 calls per caller per channel per hour

Body parameters:

- `channelId` - id of channel to remove user from
- `removeFid` - fid of the user to remove
- `role` - either of:
  - `member`: removes user from member role or revokes an existing member invitation. If the user was removed, the user is blocked from becoming a member again via a link (i.e. to become a member again, they have to be invited by a moderator). If only an invitation was revoked, the user is not blocked from becoming a member via a link. The caller must be a channel moderator or the channel owner.
  - `moderator`: removes user from moderator role or revokes an existing moderator invitation. The caller must be the channel owner.

Returns:

- `success: true`

Example:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Auth Token>' \
  -d '{ "channelId": "evm", "removeFid": 341234, "role": "member" }' \
  https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-invites

  https://api.warpcast.com/fc/channel-invites
```

## Moderate Channel Cast

`POST /fc/moderated-casts`
