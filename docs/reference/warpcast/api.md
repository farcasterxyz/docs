# Warpcast API Reference

This page documents public APIs provided by Warpcast with information that is not available on the protocol.

**Authentication**: All endpoints are unauthenticated.

**Pagination**: paginated endpoints return a `next.cursor` property next to the `result` object. This parameter should be sent
back to fetch the next page. An optional `limit` parameter can be used to specify the page size.

```json
{
  "result": {
    ...
  },
  "next": {
    "cursor": "eyJwYWdlIjoxLCJsaW1pdCI6MTAwfQ"
  }
}
```

## Channel APIs

Warpcast has the concept of channels which build upon FIP-2 (setting `parentUrl` on casts). You can read more
about channels in the [documentation](https://www.notion.so/warpcast/Channels-4f249d22575348a5a0488b5d86f0dd1c?pvs=4).

### Get All Channels

List all Warpcast channels. There are no parameters and no pagination.

```bash
curl https://api.warpcast.com/v2/all-channels | jq
```

Returns: an array of channel objects:

```json

    "channels": [
      {

        "name": "Welcome",
        "description": "A place to welcome new users to Farcaster! Share how you know each other, tag folks that should meet them, and add a photo or two!",
        "imageUrl": "https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieraqfkny7bttxd7h7kmnz6zy76vutst3qbjgjxsjnvrw7z3i2n7i",

- `id` - unique channel id that cannot be changed (called 'Name' when creating a channel)

## Get All Power Badge Users

Warpcast grants power badges to users who are active, interesting to others and not spammy.
You can read more about power badges in the [documentation](https://warpcast.notion.site/Power-Badge-d81fea2e953e4dafae7c85295ffaf3ae).

This endpoint provides the list of all users who currently hold a power badge. The endpoint has no parameters and does not paginate.

```bash
curl https://api.warpcast.com/v2/power-badge-users | jq
```

Returns: a JSON array with fids of users who currently hold a power badge:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "fids": [
      1,
      2,
      ...

```

Warpcast recalculates badge ownership once every week, on Tuesdays at 12:00:00 UTC.
