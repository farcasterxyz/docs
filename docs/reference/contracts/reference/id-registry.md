# Id Registry

The Id Registry records which fid is associated with which Ethereum address, and manages fid transfers and recoveries.

If you want to read information about an fid, transfer or recover an fid, or manage an fid's recovery address, use the
Id Registry.

If you want to register a new fid, use the [ID Gateway](/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway.md) instead.

## Read

### idOf

Returns the fid (`uint256`) owned by an address, or returns zero if the address does not own an fid.

| Parameter | type      | Description                     |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| owner     | `address` | The address to check for an fid |

### custodyOf

Returns the custody address (`address`) that owns a specific fid. Returns the zero address if the fid does not exist.

| Parameter | type      | Description                   |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| fid       | `uint256` | The fid to find the owner for |

### recoveryOf

Returns the recovery address (`address`) of an fid. Returns the zero address if the fid does not exist.

| Parameter | type      | Description                              |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |

### idCounter

Returns the highest registered fid (`uint256`) so far.

### verifyFidSignature

Checks that a message was signed by the current custody address of an fid. Returns a `bool`.

| Parameter      | type      | Description                           |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| custodyAddress | `address` | The address to check the signature of |
| fid            | `uint256` | The fid associated with the signature |

| sig            | `bytes`   | Signature to check                    |

### nonces

Returns the next unused nonce (`uint256`) for an address. Used for generating EIP-712 signatures.

| Parameter | type      | Description                      |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| owner     | `address` | The address to get the nonce for |

## Write

### register

Will revert if called directly. Must be called via the [ID Gateway](/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway.md).

### changeRecoveryAddress

Change the recovery address for the caller's fid.

| Parameter | type      | Description              |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| recovery  | `address` | The new recovery address |

### transfer

Transfer the caller's fid to a new address. The `to` address must sign an EIP-712 [`Transfer`](#transfer-signature)
message accepting the transfer. The `to` address must not already own an fid.

| Parameter | type      | Description                                                               |

| sig       | `bytes`   | EIP-712 [`Transfer`](#transfer-signature) signature from the `to` address |

::: warning
Transferring an fid does not reset its recovery address. To transfer an fid and update its recovery address,
call [`transferAndChangeRecovery`](#transferandchangerecovery). If you are receiving an fid from an untrusted sender,
ensure its recovery address is cleared or changed on transfer.
:::

#### Transfer signature

To transfer an fid to another account, the caller must provide an EIP-712 typed signature from the receiving address in
the following format:

`Transfer(uint256 fid,address to,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)`

| Parameter | type      | Description                         |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| fid       | `uint256` | The fid being transferred           |
| to        | `address` | The address receiving the fid.      |
| nonce     | `uint256` | Current nonce of the signer address |
| deadline  | `uint256` | Signature expiration timestamp      |
