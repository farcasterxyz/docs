# Frames have been rebranded to Mini Apps

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
As of early 2025, Frames have been rebranded to Mini Apps to better reflect their evolving capabilities and scope. All Frames documentation and resources have been migrated to the [Mini Apps](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/){target="_self"} ecosystem.

Frames v1 have been deprecated and will be supported only until the end of March 2025. We strongly recommend using Mini Apps for all new projects.
