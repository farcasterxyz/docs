# Introduction

Farcaster is a [sufficiently decentralized](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) social network. It is an open protocol that can support many clients, just like email. Users will always have the freedom to move their social identity between applications, and developers will always have the freedom to build applications with new features on the network.
