An address can only own a single fid at a time, but fids can be transferred between addresses. The address that currently owns an fid is known as the <code>custody address</code> and can sign messages on behalf of the fid.</p><p>Ownership of fids is fully decentralized and they never expire.

They are ERC-721 tokens that can be transferred between addresses. Fnames can be up to 16 characters including lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens. Fnames can be registered for one year at a time and must be renewed by paying a fee.</p><p>Fnames are optional, cosmetic identifiers for the Farcaster network to make fids easily addressable.
