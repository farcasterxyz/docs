# What is Farcaster?

Farcaster is a protocol for building new kinds of social networks.

It is a [sufficiently decentralized](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) protocol where users control their data and developers can build apps permissionlessly on the network.

Farcaster is still in private beta and an invitation is required. You can get invites from existing users or by messaging [@dwr](https://twitter.com/dwr) on Twitter.
