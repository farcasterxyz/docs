Farcaster is free during the Goerli testnet phase. After Farcaster migrates to Ethereum mainnet, it will cost ~$10 a year to have an account. Users will pay the protocol directly.

## Why is Farcaster invite only?

For now, invites are limited to minimize spam. If you're a person who actively engages on social networks or writes code, you shouldn't have a problem getting an invite. We're working on opening the system so that anyone can register by the end of the year.
