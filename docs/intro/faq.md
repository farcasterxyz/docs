# FAQ

## Who is building Farcaster?

Farcaster is an open-source protocol created by a community of users and developers. The repository is maintained by the [Farcaster core team](https://github.com/orgs/farcasterxyz/teams/core/members) with contributions made by over 50 developers.

## What blockchain is Farcaster built on?

Farcaster's identity layer is currently on the Goerli Ethereum testnet. We plan to migrate to Ethereum mainnet in 2023. Read more about our plans [here](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/rkfR8q0k2).

## What does it cost to use Farcaster?

Farcaster is free during the Goerli testnet phase. After Farcaster migrates to Ethereum mainnet, it will cost ~$10 a year to have an account. Users will pay the protocol directly.

## Why is Farcaster invite only?
For now, invites are limited to minimize spam. If you're a person who actively engages on social networks or writes code, you shouldn't have a problem getting an invite. We're working on opening the system so that anyone can register by the end of the year.
