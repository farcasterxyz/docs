# Community

The developer community is a great place to get help, learn new things, and find interesting people to work with.

## Telegram Channels

Telegram channels are helpful for staying up-to-date with recent developments and having quick, asynchronous conversations.

Developer calls take place every other week at 10am Pacific Time. They last for 45 minutes and are recorded and posted to YouTube. The core team proposes the agenda and runs the meeting. Anyone can suggest new topics for discussion by leaving a comment on the meeting agenda or proposing it live during the meeting.
