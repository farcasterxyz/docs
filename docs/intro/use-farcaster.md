# Use Farcaster

## Get an invite

An invite is required to create a profile and start casting. There are three ways to get one:

1. Message [@dwr](https://twitter.com/dwr) on Twitter
2. Ask someone you know who is already on Farcaster for an invite
3. Run a [Farcaster Hub](../developers/hubs.md) on mainnet

For now, invites are limited to minimize spam. If you're a person who actively engages on social networks or writes code, you shouldn't have a problem getting an invite. We're working on opening the system so that anyone can register by the end of the year.
