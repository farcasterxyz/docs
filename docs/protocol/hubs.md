# Hubs

A Hub is a node in the Farcaster network that stores a copy of all data.

Hubs accept messages from users and replicate them to each other in real-time in a peer-to-peer fashion. A Hub will store every active message on the network and can be used to submit new messages. Running a Hub is a great way to get permissionless access to data and to help with decentralizing the network.
