# Specification

The specification defines the exact logic that Hubs and Contracts should implement. 

Specifications are versioned by their release date(e.g. `2023.3.1`). They are updated every 6 weeks when a new version of the Farcaster protocol is released.

The full specification lives [on Github](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/blob/main/docs/SPECIFICATION.md).
