# Example apps

The Farcaster Connect repo includes several [example applications](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/connect-monorepo/tree/main/examples).

## Frontend only

A [frontend only app](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/connect-monorepo/tree/main/examples/frontend-only) using React, Typescript, and Vite. If you're building a simple connected app without an API backend, this is a good example.

## NextAuth.js

A [Next.js application](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/connect-monorepo/tree/main/examples/with-next-auth) using server side sessions and [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/). If you're building a more complex connected app with a backend API and server side sessions, this example demonstrates how to use Sign in With Farcaster for authentication.
