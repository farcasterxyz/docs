# Frames Introduction

Frames are a way to build interactive apps that run directly in a Farcaster
social feed.

They can be used to create rich in-feed experiences for web applications:

- NFTS shared from [Zora](https://zora.co/) and [Highlight](https://highlight.xyz/) can be minted in-feed
- Newsletters shared from [Paragraph](https://paragraph.xyz/) can read inline and subscribed to in-feed
- Markets shared from [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) let users place bets in-feed

Or standalone experiences like polls and games:

- spot and mint wild animals on a live-feed of a watering hole in the Namib Desert with [Safaricaster](https://warpcast.com/mattkim/0x3d165bb8)
- make an onchain payment to another user with [Paybot](https://app.paycaster.co)
- RSVP to an [Eventcaster](https://warpcast.com/toadyhawk.eth/0xcb4aefe8) event
- [Yoink](https://warpcast.com/horsefacts.eth/0x70019199) the flag in this simple yet viral social game
- generate a [Waifu NFT](https://warpcast.com/horsefacts.eth/0xbc7d33ca) based on your Farcaster profile
