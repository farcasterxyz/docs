# Frames v2 Introduction

[Frames](../index.md) launched in January 2024 as a way to build interactive apps that run directly in a Farcaster social feed. They enabled developers to identify users, connect wallets, and take limited actions on and offchain.

Although we saw many apps built, they were held back by several limitations:

- Limited size and capabilities
- Slow image-based rendering
- Ephemeral and hard to find and save

## A New Standard

We're working on a new frame standard to enable richer social applications.

New features include:

- A full screen interactive canvas based on HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Reliable and fast mobile wallet transactions
- Ability to save, search, and discover frames
- Access to native mobile notifications
- Farcaster native actions, like follows and channel invitations
- Developer attribution
