# Introduction

Sign In with Farcaster (SIWF) is way for users to sign into any app using their
Farcaster identity.

When a user signs into your application with Farcaster you'll be able to use
public social data like their social graph and profile information to bootstrap
their onboarding experience.

### How does it work?

2. Wait for the user to click, scan a QR code and approve the request in Warpcast.
3. Receive and verify a signature from Warpcast.
4. Show the logged in user's profile picture and username.

You can read about the underlying standard in [FIP-11: Sign In With
Farcaster](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/110).
