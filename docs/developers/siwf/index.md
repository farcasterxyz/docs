title: Sign In with Farcaster
---

# Introduction

Sign In with Farcaster (SIWF) is way for users to sign into any app using their
Farcaster identity.

When a user signs into your application with Farcaster you'll be able to use
public social data like their social graph and profile information to provide
a streamlined onboarding experience and social-powered features.

### How does it work?

1. Show a "Sign in with Farcaster" button to the user.
2. Wait for the user to click, scan a QR code and approve the request in Warpcast.
3. Receive and verify a signature from Warpcast.
4. Show the logged in user's profile picture and username.
