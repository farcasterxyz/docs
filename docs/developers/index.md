# Getting Started

If you're new to building on Farcaster follow this guide to get up to speed quickly.

## 1. Set up a Hub

Getting a hub set up lets you start querying data. Roughly speaking, a hub is to Farcaster what a node is to Ethereum.

1. Choose between [self-hosting](/hubble/install) or using a [hosting service](/hubble/hubble#hosted-instances).
2. Make your first [API call](/developers/guides/basics/setting-up) to fetch data.

## 2. Hello World

The Hello World example will walk you through the basics of creating a new acccount and writing your first message.

1. If you've never used Farcaster, [start with Warpcast](../intro/create-account.md).
2. If you've used Farcaster, complete the [Hello World](/developers/guides/basics/hello-world) example.

## 3. Explore advanced topics

Once you understand the basics, you can explore the advanced tutorials:

- [Create accounts efficiently with a bundler](./guides/advanced/register-a-user.md)
