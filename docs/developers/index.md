# Developer Overview

To get started developing on top of the farcaster protocol, first you need to decide which hub to connect to. There are
a few options:

- [Run your own hub](/hubble/install)
- [Connect to a 3rd party hub](/hubble/hubble#hosted-instances)

For one off read-only queries, you could also use the Farcaster team's [public hub](/hubble/hubble#public-instances).
Note that this hub is read-only, and has strict rate limits.
