# Community

The developer community is a great place to get help, learn new things and find interesting people to work with.

## Telegram Channels

Telegram channels are useful for staying up to date on recent developments and having quick, asynchronous conversations.

Anyone can suggest new topics for discussion by leaving a comment on the meeting agenda or proposing it live during the meeting.
