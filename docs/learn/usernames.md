# Usernames

Users can associate ENS names with their accounts making it easy for others to mention them in messages. Names must be
less than 16 characters and only contain lowercase alphabets, numbers or hyphens to prevent homoglyph attacks.

Farcaster supports two kinds of ENS names today:

- **fnames**, which are free and governed by farcaster.
- **.eth names**, which cost money and are user-controlled.
