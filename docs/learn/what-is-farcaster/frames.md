# Frames

A Frame lets you turn any cast into an interactive app.

It’s a standard for creating interactive and authenticated experiences on Farcaster. Create polls, live feeds or interactive galleries inside Warpcast or any other FC client.

Frames extend the OpenGraph standard and turn static embeds into interactive experiences. The diagram below shows the difference between a standard OG and a Frame OG inside Warpcast.

Creating a frame is simple — choose an image to show and add buttons the user can click on. If a button is clicked, you get a callback and can send another image with more buttons.
